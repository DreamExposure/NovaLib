## About

NovaLib is a robust API for bukkit plugins. It handles NMS code for you so that you don't have to build 10 versions of the same plugin or handle complex class loading. NovaLib also integrates easy to use file utilities, database utilities and so much more!

NovaLib can also be used for Bungee Servers to handle cross-server talk and more.

NovaLib is mainly static typed allowing you to use the various hooks without needing a constant reference to the plugin.

## Current Features

- NMS packet handling so you don't have to touch NMS code.
- CustomConfig object to easily handle custom configs/files for you
- Database API for easy connections to MySQL databases.
- File/folder utilities for convenience.
- Custom entity handling (Work inProgress).
- EXP Timers.
- Easy and simple communicate between Servers in a Bungeecord network.
- Command API for simplifying the way you make commands (and simplifying complex commands)
- And more!


## Planned and In-Progress Features

- SQLite support
- Full and robust minigames API built in (replace NovaGamesLib; WIP)
- Further handling of even more NMS code for you
- Custom Entity handling/API (Work in Progress)
- And more!
